##Składniki na 2 porcje:
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 40g knob of ginger
- 1 medium hot red chilli
- 2 tbsp of groundnut oil
- 2 tsp of yellow mustard seeds
- 400g of canned, chopped tomatoes
- 2 medium-sized onions
- 1 tsp of cumin seeds
- 50g of whole cashew nuts
- can of chickpeas
- chopped coriander


Peel and thinly slice 2 cloves of garlic. Peel a 40g knob of ginger and cut it into matchsticks. Finely chop 1 medium hot red chilli. Warm 2 tbsp of groundnut oil in a saucepan, add the garlic, ginger and chilli and fry for 2 or 3 minutes over a moderate heat, until the garlic is pale gold.

Stir in 2 tsp of yellow mustard seeds. Let them cook for a couple of minutes then stir in 400g of canned, chopped tomatoes and leave to cook for 15 minutes, giving it the occasional stir.

Peel 2 medium-sized onions, halve them then cut into thick segments. Cook the onions in 2 tbsp of olive oil until soft then add 1 tsp of cumin seeds and 50g of whole cashew nuts. Fry till the onions are soft and deep gold in colour.

Drain and rinse a can of chickpeas and stir into the tomato sauce. Season carefully, then, when piping hot, divide between 2 bowls. Spoon the onion and cashews on top and serve, if you wish, with a little chopped coriander stirred through at the last minute. Enough for 2.
