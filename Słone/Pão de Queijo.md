### Ingredients

- 200g grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 cup milk
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 2 eggs
- 455g tapioca flour
- 2 tsp salt


**Step 1** – Simmer the milk and the oil, then pour it hot into the bowl with the tapioca flour.

**Step 2** – using a wooden spoon, mix it to combine. You’ll notice that the mixture will not be homogeneous, it’ll be gummy and clumpy, which is totally normal. At this point, we need to let that mixture cool off a bit, about 10-15 minutes.

**Step 3** – After the tapioca mixture cooled off, you can go ahead and mix it with the cheese and egg mixture.

**Step 4** – Keep mixing and massaging it until you have a homogeneous mixture that comes together as a ball. You’ll still see some white tapioca specks in the dough.

**Step 5** – Oil your hands and scoop about 2-Tbsp size portions into your hand. I like to also give the dough a little squeeze, to make sure there aren’t any dry/unmixed spots inside. 

**Step 6** – roll a perfect little ball.

**To freeze.** Arrange the little pão de queijo balls in a baking sheet side by side. Then, pop the baking sheet in the freezer so the cheese breads can start to hold their shape. After about 10-15 minutes you can just place them into ziplock bags and freeze to bake later.

**To bake.** Just arrange your perfect little balls (or your lazy scoops) in a baking sheet approximately 2″ apart from one another to allow for air to circulate around them while they bake. Bake in a preheated oven 175°C until they’re lightly golden (about 20 mins) and enjoy!
