### INGREDIENTS
- 2 cups all-purpose flour (or a combo with whole-wheat)
- 1 tsp sea salt
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 4 Tbsp ghee or clarified butter
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/3 cup water or milk (as needed)

For the filling:
- [[Labneh]]
- olives
- zaatar / [[Dukkah]]
- honey

----
1.  Mix the flour, salt, sugar, baking powder in a bowl. Add the ghee or butter and oil and mix with a fork or fingers or in a food processor; add a bit of water or milk until a dough forms. Wrap the dough in plastic and let it rest 30 minutes.
2.  Preheat the oven to 375F. Roll out the dough on a floured counter and cut circles with the rim of a glass. Mix the zaatar, oil, labneh and onion in a bowl. Place a tablespoon on each circle and fold the circle by pinching it and turning over the edges to prevent any leaks.
3.  Set the hand pies on a parchment-lined cookie sheet and bake for about 15 minutes or until dry and golden.
