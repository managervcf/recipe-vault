Tofu można zamienić na #tempeh, #pieczarki, #ciecierzyca.

### INGREDIENTS
-   1 8oz (225 g) package tempeh
-   1 1/2 cups filtered water, divided
-   1/4 cup natural creamy peanut butter
-   2 tablespoons low-sodium tamari (or soy sauce, liquid aminos)
-   1 tablespoon rice vinegar
-   1 tablespoon maple syrup
-   1 teaspoon sriracha
-   Sliced green onion and sesame seeds, for garnish (_optional_)

### INSTRUCTIONS

1.  Remove the tempeh from its packaging and cut in half. Cut each half into 8 even cubes (by cutting into fourths length and width-wise), then repeat with the other half block.
2.  Place the tempeh and 3/4 cup of water into a medium saucepan over high heat. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Let the tempeh “steam” for 5 minutes to get rid of its bitter flavor.
3.  While the tempeh is steaming, mix the peanut butter, tamari, vinegar, maple syrup, and sriracha together in a small bowl to form a thick paste.
4.  After 5 minutes have passed, push the tempeh to one side of the pan and add the peanut paste to the remaining liquid; use a spatula to dissolve it into the water and evenly coat the tempeh.
5.  Once the tempeh is coated, add an additional 1/4 cup (for a thicker sauce) to 3/4 cup (for extra sauce to coat veggies) of water to the saucepan and mix into the tempeh. The sauce will lighten in color immediately as the peanut butter mixes with the water. Simmer the tempeh for an additional 5-7 minutes, until the sauce has thickened to your liking.
6.  Serve warm, and as desired. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days. To reheat, add the tempeh to a pan with a splash of water and mix well until the sauce loosens.
