## Ingredients

-   1 tablespoon olive oil
-   1 onion
-   1 red bell pepper
-   2 cloves garlic
-   1 cup frozen corn kernels
-   1 15.5-ounce can black beans
-   1 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes
-   2 teaspoons chili powder
-   1 teaspoon cumin
-   1 cup long-grain white rice
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   1 cup shredded cheddar, Monterey Jack or pepper jack cheese
-   cilantro

## Preparation

1.  In a Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot with a lid, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add the onion and bell pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are tender and the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, corn and black beans and cook until the corn and beans are heated through, about 2 minutes.
2.  Stir in 1 1/2 cups water, the diced tomatoes and their juices, chili powder, cumin, rice and a pinch of salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat and simmer until the rice is cooked, about 20 minutes.
3.  Stir in the cheese until melted. Taste for seasoning and serve garnished with chopped cilantro.
