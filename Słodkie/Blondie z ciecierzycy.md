### Ingredients

-   15 oz. can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
-   5 Tbsp. pure maple syrup or honey
-   1/2 cup + 1 Tbsp. natural peanut butter
-   1 tsp. vanilla extract
-   1/4 tsp. baking soda
-   1/4 tsp. baking powder
-   1/4 tsp. salt (add extra 1/8 tsp. if using unsalted peanut butter)
-   1/2 cup semisweet or dark chocolate chips, plus a few extra to sprinkle on top

### Instructions

-   Preheat oven to 180 degrees.
    
-   Add chickpeas, maple syrup, peanut butter, and vanilla to a powerful blender or food processor. Blend until smooth, and then add salt, baking powder, and baking soda, and blend again. Stir in chocolate chips.
    
-   Line a baking dish with parchment paper or spray with cooking spray and spread cookie dough into an even layer. Sprinkle a few extra chocolate chips on top. 
    
-   Bake for 22-25 minutes, until the top is just beginning to slightly brown or a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out mostly clean.
    

### Notes

Although I think typical cookies and blondies taste great when they're super gooey, I personally find that you can taste the chickpeas in these blondies if they are not baked long enough. So, slightly under-baked, but not too gooey, is ideal.
